## Security Model

### üîí Data Isolation
- **Employee Scope**: Employees can only see their own data
- **Admin Scope**: Admins can see all employees in their organization
- **Organization Scope**: Users can only access their organization's data
- **Role-Based Access**: JWT tokens contain role information for authorization

### üõ°Ô∏è Access Control
- **Authentication Required**: All endpoints require valid JWT tokens
- **Role Authorization**: Endpoints check user role (admin vs employee)
- **Data Filtering**: Responses are filtered based on user permissions
- **Field Restrictions**: Employees can only update specific fields

## Case Creation Readiness

### üéØ Perfect for Case Management
This access model is ideal for case creation because:

1. **Employee Identification**: Each employee has a unique ID for case assignment
2. **Admin Assignment**: Employees know who their admin is for case routing
3. **Profile Completeness**: Employees can maintain their contact information
4. **Status Tracking**: Employee status affects case assignment eligibility
5. **Data Privacy**: Employees cannot see other employees' cases or data
6. **Admin Control**: Admins can assign cases to any employee

### üìã Case Assignment Flow
1. **Admin creates case** ‚Üí Can assign to any employee
2. **Employee receives case** ‚Üí Can see case details and their own profile
3. **Employee updates case** ‚Üí Can only modify their assigned cases
4. **Admin monitors progress** ‚Üí Can see all cases and employees

## Frontend Implementation

### Employee Dashboard
```javascript
// Employee can see:
- Their own profile information

```

### Admin Dashboard
```javascript
// Admin can see:
