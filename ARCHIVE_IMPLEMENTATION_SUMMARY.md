# Employee Archive Feature - Implementation Summary

## ‚úÖ What Was Implemented

### 1. Database Model Changes (`src/models/Employee.js`)

**Added 4 new fields to Employee schema:**

```javascript
employmentStatus: {
    type: String,
    enum: ['employed', 'archived'],
    default: 'employed'
},
archivedAt: {
    type: Date,
    default: null
},
archivedBy: {
    type: mongoose.Schema.ObjectId,
    ref: 'User',
    default: null
},
archiveReason: {
    type: String,
    maxlength: [200, 'Archive reason cannot exceed 200 characters'],
    default: null
}
```

**Purpose:**
- Separate "archived" (old employees) from "deleted" (mistakes)
- Track who archived and when
- Store reason for archiving
- All data preserved, just hidden from default view

---

### 2. Controller Functions (`src/controllers/employeeController.js`)

#### Added 2 New Functions:

**A. `archiveEmployeeByAdmin`**
- Archives employee who stopped working
- Sets `employmentStatus: 'archived'`
- Sets `status: 'terminated'`
- Records archive metadata (who, when, why)
- Adds entry to statusHistory for audit
- Returns detailed response with archive info

**B. `unarchiveEmployeeByAdmin`**
- Restores archived employee
- Sets `employmentStatus: 'employed'`
- Sets `status: 'pending'` (for admin review)
- Clears archive metadata
- Returns previous archive information
- Adds entry to statusHistory for audit

#### Updated 1 Existing Function:

**`getEmployeesForAdmin`**
- Added `includeArchived` query parameter
- Default: Shows only `employmentStatus: 'employed'`
- With `includeArchived=true`: Shows all employees
- Updated response filters to include `includeArchived` status

---

### 3. Routes (`src/routes/employeeRoutes.js`)

**Added 2 new routes:**

```javascript
// Archive employee (admin only)
router.post('/admin/:id/archive', protect, authorize('admin'), archiveEmployeeByAdmin);

// Unarchive employee (admin only)
router.put('/admin/:id/unarchive', protect, authorize('admin'), unarchiveEmployeeByAdmin);
```

**Both routes are:**
- Protected by authentication (`protect` middleware)
- Restricted to admins only (`authorize('admin')`)
- Organization-scoped (admin can only archive their org's employees)

---

### 4. Documentation

**Created 2 comprehensive documentation files:**

1. **`EMPLOYEE_ARCHIVE_API.md`**
   - Complete API documentation
   - Usage examples with cURL and axios
   - Workflow scenarios
   - Security details
   - Best practices
   - Testing guide

2. **`ARCHIVE_IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md`** (this file)
   - Quick overview of changes
   - File-by-file breakdown
   - Testing instructions

## üì° New API Endpoints

### 1. Archive Employee
```
POST /api/employees/admin/:id/archive
Authorization: Bearer <admin_token>

Body (optional):
{
  "reason": "Resigned from position",
  "notes": "Last working day: 2024-01-31"
}
```

### 2. Unarchive Employee
```
PUT /api/employees/admin/:id/unarchive
Authorization: Bearer <admin_token>

Body (optional):
{
  "notes": "Rehired for new project"
}
```

### 3. Get Employees (Updated)
```
GET /api/employees/admin/all?includeArchived=false  (default - only employed)
GET /api/employees/admin/all?includeArchived=true   (include archived)
```

## üîë Key Features

### ‚úÖ Data Preservation
- **Nothing is deleted** - all employee data preserved
- Archived employees just hidden from default view
- Can always unarchive and restore

### ‚úÖ Two Separate Systems
- **Soft Delete** (`isDeleted`) - for mistakes and errors
- **Archive** (`employmentStatus`) - for employees who stopped working
- Each serves different purpose
- Can use both independently

### ‚úÖ Complete Audit Trail
- Records who archived (`archivedBy`)
- Records when archived (`archivedAt`)
- Records why archived (`archiveReason`)
- Adds to `statusHistory` for complete trail
- Returns previous archive info on unarchive

### ‚úÖ Security
- Admin-only access
- Organization-scoped (can't access other orgs)
- JWT authentication required
- Proper authorization checks

### ‚úÖ Backward Compatible
- All existing API calls work unchanged
- Default behavior: Show only employed
- Existing employees remain visible
- No database migration needed

---

## üìù Files Modified

### 1. `src/models/Employee.js`
- ‚úÖ Added 4 new fields for archive functionality
- ‚úÖ Default values ensure backward compatibility

### 2. `src/controllers/employeeController.js`
- ‚úÖ Added `archiveEmployeeByAdmin` function (75 lines)
- ‚úÖ Added `unarchiveEmployeeByAdmin` function (80 lines)
- ‚úÖ Updated `getEmployeesForAdmin` function (added includeArchived logic)

### 3. `src/routes/employeeRoutes.js`
- ‚úÖ Added imports for new controller functions
- ‚úÖ Added 2 new routes with proper middleware

### 4. Documentation (New Files)
- ‚úÖ `EMPLOYEE_ARCHIVE_API.md` - Complete API documentation
- ‚úÖ `ARCHIVE_IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md` - This summary

## üß™ How to Test

### 1. Start Your Server
```bash
cd casesnapbackend
npm start
```

### 2. Login as Admin
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:5004/api/auth/login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email": "admin@example.com", "password": "your_password"}'
```

Save the token from the response.

### 3. Get Active Employees (Default)
```bash
curl -X GET "http://localhost:5004/api/employees/admin/all" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN"
```

Should show only employed employees.

### 4. Archive an Employee
```bash
curl -X POST "http://localhost:5004/api/employees/admin/EMPLOYEE_ID/archive" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"reason": "Employee resigned", "notes": "Last day: 2024-01-31"}'
```

### 5. Verify Employee is Hidden
```bash
curl -X GET "http://localhost:5004/api/employees/admin/all" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN"
```

Archived employee should NOT appear in the list.

### 6. Get All Employees (Including Archived)
```bash
curl -X GET "http://localhost:5004/api/employees/admin/all?includeArchived=true" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN"
```

Now you should see the archived employee with `employmentStatus: "archived"`.

### 7. Unarchive the Employee
```bash
curl -X PUT "http://localhost:5004/api/employees/admin/EMPLOYEE_ID/unarchive" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"notes": "Rehired employee"}'
```

### 8. Verify Employee is Back
```bash
curl -X GET "http://localhost:5004/api/employees/admin/all" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN"
```

Employee should appear again with `employmentStatus: "employed"` and `status: "pending"`.

## üìä What Happens When You Archive

### Before Archive:
```json
{
  "employmentStatus": "employed",
  "status": "active",
  "archivedAt": null,
  "archivedBy": null,
  "archiveReason": null
}
```

### After Archive:
```json
{
  "employmentStatus": "archived",
  "status": "terminated",
  "archivedAt": "2024-01-15T10:30:00.000Z",
  "archivedBy": "admin_user_id",
  "archiveReason": "Employee resigned"
}
```

### After Unarchive:
```json
{
  "employmentStatus": "employed",
  "status": "pending",
  "archivedAt": null,
  "archivedBy": null,
  "archiveReason": null
}
```

## üìö Next Steps

### For Backend:
1. ‚úÖ Implementation complete - no further backend changes needed
2. Test the endpoints with your actual data
3. Verify organization scoping works correctly
